**Notes**
* This is a quickly put together Android app to show the Path of Lowest Cost solver in action.  It is missing many things that I would add to a real app, including:
* It works only well in portrait.
* I haven't spent any time extracting styles from the main layout file into the styles file.
* The UI is somewhat no frills.

* What it does hopefully show is that I know Android and can whip up something simple in an hour or so.
* I do have an example of tests that I've done for other apps, see below.
